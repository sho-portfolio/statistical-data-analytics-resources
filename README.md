# Statistical Data Analytics Resources
Excellent resources relating to statistical data analytics (primarily correlation analysis)


## discussion on different types of forecasting analytics (lexicon and topology)
- https://hbr.org/1971/07/how-to-choose-the-right-forecasting-technique
- discussion on types of basic forcasting techniques:
  - qaualitative (delphi method, market research, panel consensus, visionary forecast, historical analogy)
  - time-series & projection (moving average, exponential smoothing, box-jenkins, X-11, trend projections)
  - casual methods (regression model, econometric, intention-to-buy & anticipation surveys, input-output  model, economic input-output model, diffusion index, lading indicator, life-cycle analysis)

## quant trading strategy walk through (part 3 in the most interesting)
- https://www.learndatasci.com/tutorials/python-finance-part-3-moving-average-trading-strategy/
- [discussion on different types of moving average (EMA vs. SMA)]
- [a worked example of time series analysis for stock data and code showing how to download stick prices from google]

## phi coefficient (correlation between 2 dichotomous (e.g. boolean) variables)
- https://www.slideshare.net/plummer48/what-is-a-phi-coefficient
- [a simple worked example on how to compute the phi coefficient]

## point biserial correlation (correlation between a dichotomous and a continuous variable)
- https://www.slideshare.net/plummer48/null-hypothesis-for-point-biserial-39817338
- https://www.slideshare.net/plummer48/point-biserial-correlation?next_slideshow=1
- [point biserial correlation is a value that that makes it possible to statistically test the relationship between a dichotomous and continuous variable]
- [point biserial correlation is an estimate of the cherence between a dichotomous and continuous variable]

## types of correlation and which one to use based on your variable (data) types of X & Y
- https://www.andrews.edu/~calkins/math/edrm611/edrm13.htm
- [to be confirmed but read: nominal=dichotomous, quantitative=continuos, ordinal=ranked?)
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6107969/
- [another interesting look at the different types of corelation as well as how different studies have ranked/categorized the statistical significance of each]
- https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-use-correlation-to-understand-the-relationship-between-variables/

## types of correlation (contingency table) for nominal / dichotomous data
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table
- [discusses: phi, cramer V, Tetrachoric (polychoric is for more than 2 variables) etc.

## how to interpret the results of a phi coefficient calculation
- https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/phi-coefficient-mean-square-contingency-coefficient/
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6107969/

## a dictionary of statistcal terms
- https://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx
- i.e. select 'marginal distribution' from the drop down - the description helped me understand the following statement related to the 'fastng' dataset: "The value of Phi not only depends on the degree of association between 2 caracteristics, but also on the degree of symmetry of the marginal distributions. If marginal distributions are asymmetric (as is here the case for fast), then Phi is diminished."

## how to compute odds-ratio (OR) & confidence-intervals (CI)
- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2938757/

## a clear worked example of how to compute OR, RR & CI
http://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/MPH-Modules/PH717-QuantCore/PH717_ComparingFrequencies/PH717_ComparingFrequencies8.html

## calculator for computing odds-ratio (OR) and confidence-interval (CI)
- https://select-statistics.co.uk/calculators/confidence-interval-calculator-odds-ratio/

## a lookup table (see section B) giving z-scores aka critical-values for a given confidence-level (used in the computation of confidence-intervals (CI)
- https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/probability-and-statistics/find-critical-values/
